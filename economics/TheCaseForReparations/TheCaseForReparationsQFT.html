	<h3>Finding Evidence</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>In the 1920s, Jim Crow Mississippi
was, in all facets of society, a
kleptocracy. The majority of the people
in the state were perpetually <b>robbed</b> of
the vote—a hijacking engineered
through the trickery of the poll tax and
the muscle of the lynch mob. Between
1882 and 1968, more black people were
lynched in Mississippi than in any
other state. </p>
	</blockquote>
<p>The term <em>kleptocracy</em> is followed immediately by talking about <em>robbery</em> by the government. By using context clues, we can see that <b>kleptocracy</b> is a government that uses its power to steal resources. 
	<blockquote>
<p>The state’s regime partnered <b>robbery</b>
of the franchise with <b>robbery</b> of the
purse. Many of Mississippi’s black
farmers lived in debt peonage, under
the sway of cotton kings who were at
once their landlords, their employers,
and their primary merchants. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>We've read about this system of <b>debt peonage</b> <a href="/economics/FiscalDebates/Sharecropping.html">before</a>.
	
	<p>We learned about <a href="http://bsk.education/economics/FiscalDebates/Sharecropping.html">Sharecropping and Jim Crow</a>, economic and political systems designed to keep African Americans subservient agricultural labor in the wake of the Civil War.</p>
	<p>We followed African-Americans as they <a href="http://bsk.education/economics/FiscalDebates/TheGreatMigration.html">journeyed North</a>, looking for a better life. We saw the reality of their <a href="http://bsk.education/economics/FiscalDebates/ChicagoRaceRiot.html">arrival</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Using Evidence</h3>
	
	<p>Your essay prompt asks you to answer two questions:</p>
		<span style="font-family: Fugaz One; color: #FF4396; font-size: 32px;">How do economic conditions affect racism?<br>How does race affect the economy?</span>
	<p>After reading the first two sections of <em>&ldquo;The Case for Reparations&rdquo;</em>, we have a lot more evidence to support our claims.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Look over your notes from sections 1 & 2. Sort your information into two groups: does it discuss race affecting the economy, or economics affecting racism?</li>
		<li>Go back to the source, and look for a supporting quote. <mark>Be careful! Are you quoting Coates or one of <em>his</em> sources?</mark></li>
		<li>Add <b>at least 3</b> quotes from sections 1 & 2 into your essay.</li> 
	</ol>
	
	<h4>Example</h4>
	<p>After the slaves were freed, they were kept in the south. They were a threat to the Southern economy, because if they were ever to migrate out of the south (which they did) it would bring nothing but chaos for the white southerners. Not only were African Americans being held back but they were being used as tools to keep up the economy, kept from leaving by the laws of Southern states.

	
	<blockquote>“It was in these early years that Ross began to understand himself as an American—he did
not live under the blind decree of justice, but under the heel of a regime that elevated
armed robbery to a governing principle.”<footer>The Case for Reparations</footer></blockquote>

<p>The Southern economy relied on free labor, and because slaves were now free, Southern governments came up with new ways to force cheap labor. But the freed slaves would only remain in the south as long as debt traps kept them. As the Southern economy continued basically the same as it had under slavery, new economic opportunities in the north would shift races and race relations in the next few decades.</p>
